# projects-for-resume by Samuel Haupt

Projects for resume provide a glimpse into my programming abilities to potential employers. Please see comments at the beginning of each program for creation date.

For the first project, I built a machine language assembler for a rudimentary computer through coursera.com (Build a Modern Computer From First Principles).
For the second project, I built a Korean chess game called Janggi for my second introductory course at Oregon State 
University.
For the next project I built a quantitative stock analysis tool for personal use. The tool is used to scrape data from investing.com in order to analyze stock data based on performance and volume filters.

All programs have been built within a two year time period.
