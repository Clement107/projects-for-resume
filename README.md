# projects-for-resume

Projects for resume provide a glimpse into programming abilities to potential employers.

For the first project, I built a machine language assembler for a rudimentary computer through coursera.com (Build a Modern Computer From First Principles).
For the second project, I built a chess-like game called Janggi. It is a Korean chess game. I built this game for my second introductory course at Oregon State 
University. The next project I built a quantitative stock analysis tool out of a personal desire. The tool is used to scrape data from investing.com in order to
analysis stock data based on performance and volume filters.

All programs have been built within a one year time period.
